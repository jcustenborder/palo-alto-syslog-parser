    "Receive Time":"Time the log was received at the management plane.",
    "Serial Number":"Serial number of the firewall that generated the log.",
    "Type":"Specifies type of log; values are traffic, threat, config, system and hip-match.",
    "Threat/Content Type":"Subtype of threat log. Values include the following:\r\ndata - Data pattern matching a Data Filtering profile.\r\nfile - File type matching a File Blocking profile.\r\nflood - Flood detected via a Zone Protection profile.\r\npacket - Packet-based attack protection triggered by a Zone Protection profile.\r\nscan - Scan detected via a Zone Protection profile.\r\nspyware - Spyware detected via an Anti-Spyware profile.\r\nurl - URL filtering log.\r\nvirus - Virus detected via an Antivirus profile.\r\nvulnerability - Vulnerability exploit detected via a Vulnerability Protection profile.\r\nwildfire - A WildFire verdict generated when the firewall submits a file to WildFire per a WildFire Analysis profile and a verdict (malicious, phishing, grayware, or benign, depending on what you are logging) is logged in the WildFire Submissions log.\r\nwildfire-virus - Virus detected via an Antivirus profile.",
    "Generated Time":"Time the log was generated on the dataplane.",

To view the device group names that correspond to the value 12, 34 or 45, use one of the following methods:",
